          <h2>About Me<br /></h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          From a young age, I've always been fascinated by how things work,
          constantly taking apart and reassembling gadgets to understand their
          inner workings. This curiosity naturally led me to a career in
          technology, where I could indulge my natural curiousity for
          problem-solving and innovation. My journey took a significant turn
          when I was deployed to Afghanistan, where I served as a military
          police officer, working closely with the Afghan Army. This experience
          instilled in me a strong work ethic and discipline, and it was during
          this time I was encouraged by special ops personnel to pursue IT. This
          advice set me on a path that led to critical roles in data center
          management and network optimization for organizations like Oracle.
        </p>

        <p>
          My career took another pivotal step during my time at UPMC
          CancerCenters, where I realized that technology could have a profound
          impact on people's lives. Although I wasn't directly helping patients,
          ensuring that the doctors and nurses had reliable technology
          reaffirmed my belief that the tech field is where I could do the most
          good for humanity. Recently, I graduated from Code Platoon's
          Full-Stack Software Engineering program and am currently participating
          in their part-time DevOps & Cloud Engineering course. My passion for
          technology extends to AI, machine learning, and innovative solutions
          in healthcare. I'm excited to continue expanding my expertise and
          collaborating with like-minded professionals. Whether you're looking
          to discuss projects, career opportunities, or simply exchange
          knowledge in the tech space, I'd love to connect!
